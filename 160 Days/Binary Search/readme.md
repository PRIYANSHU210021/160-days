AGGRESSIVE COW

This code solves the problem of placing k aggressive cows in stalls in such a way that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Input and Setup
    Input:

    stalls[]: An array of integers representing the positions of stalls.
    k: The number of cows to be placed.
    Goal: Place the cows such that the smallest distance between any two cows is as large as possible.

    First, the stalls array is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is important because the cows need to be placed in an orderly manner to maximize distances.

    Variables are initialized:

    start = 0: The smallest possible distance between cows.
    end = stalls[n-1] - stalls[0]: The largest possible distance between cows (the distance between the first and last stall).
    ans: To store the final result (maximum minimum distance).

2. Binary Search on Distance
    The code uses binary search to find the largest possible minimum distance between cows. Here's how it works:

    Calculate mid:

    mid = start + (end - start) / 2
    mid represents the current distance being tested as the minimum distance between any two cows.
    Try to Place Cows:

    Start placing cows with the first cow at the first stall (pos = stalls[0]).
    Use a loop to check if the next cow can be placed at least mid distance away from the previous one.
    Count the number of cows placed (cnt).
    Check Feasibility:

    If cnt (number of cows placed) is less than k, it means mid is too large, so reduce the search range by setting end = mid - 1.
    Otherwise, mid is feasible, so update the answer (ans = mid) and search for a larger possible distance by setting start = mid + 1.
3. Final Result
    When the binary search ends, the value of ans will hold the largest minimum distance between any two cows.

    Key Concepts
    Binary Search: Used to efficiently search for the maximum possible minimum distance.
    Greedy Placement: Cows are placed in stalls as far apart as possible while ensuring the minimum distance (mid).
    Example Walkthrough
    Input:
    stalls = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
    k = 3
    Process:
    Sort stalls: [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
    Binary Search:
    Start with start = 0, end = 8, and test different values of mid.
    Place cows for each mid value and adjust start or end based on feasibility.
    Output:
    The largest minimum distance is the maximum ans found during the search, e.g., 3 for this example.

    This ensures the cows are placed as far apart as possible while maintaining the required count.
